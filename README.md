## Introduction
This is my Python implementation of an interpreter for the Lox programming language from Robert Nystrom's *[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)*.

## Python?
While the text is implemented in Java and C as its high & low-level implementations, I have no idea how to write either of them! Instead, I'll be using Python for the high-level implementation & eventually Rust for the low-level imeplementation.

## Language Specification 
### Defined by Challenges
  * (Chapter 9): `break` statements are available for `for` and `while` loops
### User Choice
  * Strings may be defined using either `"` or `'`
  * Modulo operator (`%`)
  * Power operator (`^`)
